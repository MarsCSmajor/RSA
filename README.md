# RSA Program

Given a public key P = (e,n), you have an encoded message in which is a bunch of numbers. 
The program takes the public key p as its input along with the length of the encoded message. The length of the encoded message is calulated by q = n/p. n = pq.

Once you calculated the length of q, you can input your encoded message. 

The problem will decrypt the message into words
